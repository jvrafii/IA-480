# Water Consumption and Cost Prediction Report  

## Dataset Overview  
The dataset **Water Consumption And Cost (2013 - Feb 2025)** was sourced from [data.gov](https://www.data.gov/).  
It includes:  
- Monthly **consumption** and **cost** data  
- Borough and development details  
- Utility vendor and meter information  

## Objective  
The goal is to **predict the cost** based on the **amount of water consumed**.  

## Data Preprocessing  
- **Handled missing values**  
- **Fixed invalid characters**  
- **Corrected incorrect data types**  
- Processed in **Amazon SageMaker**  

After cleaning, the dataset was uploaded in **CSV format** and previewed before model training.  

## Model Training  
- **New model created**  
- **Predictive analysis selected**  
- Dataset prepared and uploaded  
- Configurations set:  
  - **Numeric model type**  
  - **Target column**: Cost  
  - **Grouping column**: Borough/Development  
  - **Predictor feature**: Consumption  

Since the model predicts **numeric values**, this model type was selected.  

## Model Performance  
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Accuracy** | 48.478% |
| **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)** | 29,773.32 |
| **MSE (Mean Squared Error)** | 886,450,624 |
| **R² Score** | 94.429% |

### Observations  
- **R² Score (94.429%)** suggests that a high percentage of the variance in cost is explained by the model.  
- However, **low accuracy (48.478%)** indicates the model struggles with precise predictions.  
- **High RMSE (29,773.32)** suggests large deviations between predicted and actual costs.  

The next steps would be to perform feature engineering and model tuning for greater precision and accuracy
